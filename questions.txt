Is my Schefflera plant a goner?	My Mom had this plant, it slowly died. She didn t know what it was, and was just going to throw it away. It still had some life so I said I would take it. I took it out and inspected the roots. They are healthy. I cut off the leaves as they were dead and or dying. The only healthy part that remains is a small nubby green stalk. It has healthy roots. I rinsed the roots and re-potted it in new pot and soil. Is there any chance of survival without any leaves?

At night she sleeps in the bathroom and we will only come in if she needs to go to the toilet after which she goes back to her bed. 	But she is very anxious when we put her outside or when she is settling to sleep.  We have to stay with her until she falls asleep or she whines and scratches the door. And she does the same outside scratching the glass door and whining. 	We are having a lot of trouble training this out of her and both becoming very sleep deprived and irritable.

Nightmare contractor?	So recently we had some work done in our office. I was in charge of organizing it and I had a contractor to deal with. He sent a girl who was quite young to paint our rooms. They were painted and were filled with paint all over the floors even when I gave her drop cloths. She didn't use them. She filled our sinks which got totally coated in scunge from her brushes that she never cleaned. She showed up 2 hours late almost every shift and.... She actually we found out today had taken some slats off the wall to paint.... And then she put them back and obviously used longer nails or put them in the wrong place because she drilled right through an electrical wire and now the electricity im our back room is completely out. Now they have to rip apart the wall and the new paint job which by the way she screwed the detail work up massively. Has anyone experienced something like this?

How to improve breaking off the LOS as a big WR, improve route running?	So this summer I'm working everyday on my route runnings/get offs. Because I'm 6'3 185 and bulked up since I started and I'm very fast, but my route running needs a lot of work. I've been doing drills for hours with my coaches on breaking off well but no matter what they say it's very hard for me. All the techniques don't seem to be working.It's really frustrating because I am pretty naturally athletic and good at every sport. I'm insanely fast for my size but just the littlest thing (break and sharp route running) is taking me hours and hours and I still feel like I'm making no progress.As a very tall WR, how do you break more efficiently and what are some tips for running sharper routes at my size?

Whatever excuses he may have, won't wash either. I have a feeling that he didn't prepare the players properly as it is still so early before the season starts.

Hot water heater problems?	In Sept, my air conditioner pipes leaked on my water heater &amp; shorted a fuse.  My air unit is installed above my water heater in a closet. My apartment maintenance guy replaced this fuse and caulked the panel shut in case there was another leak. 	Almost a year later my fire alarm went off one again. I noticed my water heater was incredibly hot. My bath water has been scorching hot, to a point to where I have to turn on the cold water to get it comfortable. After my fire alarm went off, I unplugged the system, waited an hour or two, and went to sleep.	Today, I decided to not take a shower at my gym &amp; plugged in my water heater. I went to work &amp; came home to find a lingering wire burnt smell. I unplugged my water heater &amp; called maintenance, which I had to leave a voicemail since it is the 4th.	My question is: will unplugging my water heater without flipping the breaker cause any harm? Will it do any good at hopefully preventing fire?	 Does the caulking on the panel of the water heater do damage? Why would they do that? 	I am losing so much sleep over this. If this problem persists, I'm going to call the fire marshal to come check things out if I suspect subpar maintenence. 	Could the thermostat in the water heater get damaged?	Shouldn't the breaker trip?	I'm more concerned about leaving my dog alone than anything and want to ensure that my apt is safe to be in. 	If anyone can, please help.

No Jawline Yet Skinny? (Read details for full story)?	Ok So I'm 1.8m, 54 kg, and 16 years old. I'm a skinny guy but what's funny is that my jaw literally looks like its connected to my neck. Especially when I am looking down, it's as if I dont have a jaw, It's like I have a head and a neck. I did some research on platysma muscle, the stronger it is, the tighter it holds all that meat and everything, Could that be my problem? Also when I make a smooch face or anything, my jaw looks super defined, I have a good head structure but i have annoying meat surrounding my jawline that makes me look like an alien. This photo I found, kind of resembles it. It looks like this only when im not talking and looking straight. But when I make facial expressions and talk, and move my head around, u cant notice it.

We re all mad here  - ive had mental health issues for a long time and it reminds me that though i may be mad so is everyone in their own way. Probably my favourite quote of all time because it has a deep meaning but sounds light hearted. My worry is the font it would be in wouldnt look very femenine. 	 Imagination is the only weapon in the war against reality  - my imagination that i will have a better future and imagining all the things in life i enjoy helped me through a lot of my dark days. It would be a very femenine tattoo due ti the style it would be done in but my worry is it may sound too cliche.

Is Westbrook and Harden a smaller version of LeBron?	I say this because all 3 are triple double machines.RW plays with aggression and force and athleticism. He will get points by driving to the rim without any remorse. His teamates do help with the rebounds. His assists sometimes I see are forced because he is not a great passer in my opinion.JH plays with pace. The Rockets are a 3 point shooting team so Harden has it easy on him with a bunch of shooters. He draws up many defenders and gets the open man. He scores the ball by getting to the free throw line, or being a deadly jump shooter. His rebounding numbers are also because of the amount of 3's his team takes. It is easier to position/predict where the ball is going if a lot of your shots are 3's. He is also good on the pick and roll.LJ is a locomotive, and when he gets to the rim no one can really stop him. He isn't much of a shooter, but he is strong and can post you up. He plays the Forward position, so he is in the paint fighting for rebounds. His high assist numbers are because of 3 point shooting. Similar to Harden. Also because he has Kyrie.

Found maggots on kitchen floor this morning. Don't know the source?	For the past couple weeks there have been more flies than usual in my house. I try to kill as many as I can but that's only so efficient. I didn't put much thought into why there were flies inside. It's summer and I live in a very hot humid area so it's normal to see the occasional fly. Other than the occasional nuisance I brushed it off. Until this morning I come out into the kitchen to find the floor covered in them. I swept them up took out the trash and recycling bins and checked the fridge and cupords for rotting food. I keep my house clean and don't leave old food out so I'm baffled as to what has cuased this. Can flies lay eggs on surface? I had assumed it needed organic material to lay eggs? Can they lay eggs in the bodies of other dead flies? I can't find the source of the maggots problem and I had assumed the flies we're coming in from the outside. Has anyone else dealt with this problem?

Advice about Siberian Husky?	My boyfriend decided to buy a husky against my advice. I have NEVER had this much trouble training a dog in my life! She is 7 months old and stubborn. She terrorizes cats (based on my research, this is normal lol), she chews on anything she can get a hold of, even the coffee table, and she can t catch on to potty training. Considering she is 7 months old and the breeder said she is potty trained and has never had this problem, I am very disappointed. I was already angry that he bought the dog, but was happy to accept the challenge of training her because my boyfriend works all of the time and doesn t have the time for her. I need advice on what to do. I know they are very intelligent and I feel like this dog has potential, but I need something to get her going I guess. I have tried everything. I researched huskies, I tried positive rewards for positive behavior, but she is a little terror running around the house! She won t listen AT ALL. I have 2 other dogs and they do just fine. I have trained many other dogs for people. This dog, however, has me stumped with her stubborn and sassy personality.

How can I move into a house and have a rottweiler?	I'm very lucky at that 24 I have no kids, a college degree, and currently work a job that pays me 50k a year.I've been trying to move out of my mother's house but my issue is finding a house to rent that will allow me to have a rottweiler as a pet. I want one mainly for protection because I'm looking to move into a house that has at least 3 bedrooms (I'm moving into a house not only for my dog to have room to run around but also so should something happen in the future, like unplanned pregnancy, I never have to worry about moving again)I can afford to pay $1200 a month for a house, but my issue is no place I've looked at will let me keep a Rottweiler. I wanted to get one as a puppy so he'll be trained early on not to bark or bite, but no place will even consider it in NC and I don't feel safe living alone without a dog. How do I work around people not accepting rottweilers? I would think being able to pay three months out would have been enough to let me have it.

I wouldn't put Peyton Manning in this debate, there's no denying his productivity and football savvy but he threw ducks and even his mechanics were ugly. I've saw Warren Moon be mentioned for throwing the tightest spiral several times, you'll always see Jeff George brought up in these best throwers debates but who do you think throws the best spiral ?

(I absolutely understand that the pricing would be different and I think that it's wonderful that our service members don't have to part ways with their animals in the case of PCS)I guess my question is do you think it's morally wrong to ask a military family to say that they are the owners of my dog in order to get him here for a cheaper price (I would absolutely compensate the family for their trouble)?

Morning meal time for puppy?	My girlfriend and I just adopted a 3 month old puppy, and I am unsure if his current breakfast time is good with our upcoming schedule changes.Currently I'm a Master's student (pretty open schedule) and she works full time (leaves at 7-7:30am, and comes home around 5-6pm).The puppy currently wakes up anywhere from 6:00-6:30am (whenever she wakes up). Immediately, he goes for a walk, then comes and plays in bed with me for a bit. I usually crate him for an hour while I go back to bed until 8:30am. I feed him at 9am, and walk him shortly after.My concern is that, in a month, I will be working EMS for a year while before starting medical school, and my shifts are 7am-7pm at least 3 times/week. I don't want to ruin his schedule on days that we both work.My question is: will he adapt to eating at 7am and then getting crated for a bit until one of our friends lets him out, and at 9am on days I am off; or is it better for me to just change my sleep schedule to wake up and feed him at 7am.TL;DR: puppy currently eats breakfast at 9am because of my schedule. My schedule is changing in a month requiring his breakfast to change to 7am. Will he adapt to the variable times, or should I change MY SCHEDULE to consistently feed him at 7am?

If you've ever been to Old Navy (or worked there) you probably have noticed that normally the clothes stay on the hangers and customers usually take them home (unless they don't want them and specify so). I recently just took on being a cashier for almost a whole shift and one of the things I found hard to do was to bag stuff efficiently. Doing it well, and quickly. It's too much work and takes too much time to take off the hangers normally, but they're hard to stuff into the bag. This may seem like a silly question but this is my first job and first time ever being a cashier and having to bag something. Since it was so hard for me to easily get the hangers in the bag I even got a very disapproving look from a customer as I tried to stuff the clothing in the bag with the hangers. This question is probably best answered by someone who works at Old Navy or someone who has worked there. (Or a similar place where hangers left with the clothes and bagged) I just want to know how you're able to do it! I was getting a bit better by the end of my shift but still found it difficult. For anyone who answers, I want to know exactly how you do it! Do you bag things as you go, or lay them all out, then put them in the bag, when in the process of checking someone out do you bag? It's a lot to handle and think about at once especially when you have to be friendly, give change back, and do everything quickly. I'm just trying to be the best I can be at my job so any help or tips is appreciated

Dog with IVDD?	So we ve had our dog zen, for about four years now. On April 4th he &quot;slipped&quot; a disk in his Lombard region. He was in a decent amount of pain and was on sedatives, muscle relaxants, pain killers and steroids for 6 weeks during his cage rest as we could not afford the costly surgery. It is now July and he has been in diapers since April. His back legs do not work, and he urinates and defecates uncontrollably. He is alert, and seems happy when he is resting outside his crate with us or scooting around the house, however he cannot go outside, he cannot run and play...and I am seriously considering his quality of life. I feel guilty for considering euthanasia but we have invested more time and energy into him than we can handle anymore. He is showing little signs of progress and I don t know if he will ever recover from this. Is euthanasia the right option? We just want him to be happy and have the best life...and I don t know if we can finanacially or emotionally provide that for him anymore. Am I wrong for thinking this way? He deserves the world.

This is 10+ years later.It doesn't bother me too much but still I would like to get it out if that's even possible. Like I said it's been multiple years since the incident so my hopes aren't that high.

Why do most British salons not do Afro textured hair?	If you are a hair dresser you should be able to do any hair type as it's all hair. It's like being a dermatologist and not being able to care for skin of black people or Asians. Then you are not a proper dermatologist because you are suppose to specialise in the health of skin and that means all skin. I understand that it has different needs but if you specialise in hair care then you should be able to do at least basic styles ? By not catering to a certain ethic group you are losing business , or is there another reason?

Is it common for dogs that get neutered, to turn very aggressive?	My neighbours dog, a year old collie recently got nurtured, and his behaviour has turned very aggressive, before he was a lovely dog, friendly never once attacked anyone or anything, and his owners are lovely people, but earlier he attacked my neighbours wife she had to go to A&amp;E the dog bite her hand and broke skin. And this isn't the first time, she got bit two days ago I saw it when they got him out the car and yesterday he bit their son who is 11 and they have a younger daughter who is 6. Earlier today we heard about his aggression and yesterday when he bit the son, they wanted to get rid of him, but the son insisted he got another chance, and well today you know the rest, 3 days 3 attacks I think they are going to get rid of him, it's not worth the risk when they got children. Even when I went round there, their dog was growling through the cage and he has never ever growled at me. I have an Alaskan Malamute when we got him done he didn't turn aggressive at all, before him we had a collie same thing he never turned aggressive. So I am wondering if it is common for dogs to turn aggressive after the snip. I think it could be his age, we got our dogs done when they were puppies, or perhaps it's the drugs affecting him from the snip. They are refusing to give the dog back to the breeder they are not under any contract so they don't have to, but because they have small kids, and a dog that has attacked people rarely find another home and well...They get put down :( any idea??

small scab on tattoo?	the tattoo isnt fresh or new its just over a month old. It got slightly infected but its healed nicely now except for a little scab on a small part of the tattoo. I was on antibiotics and that cleared the infection up brilliantly, and I also have some cream the GP gave me. The scab doesnt hurt and is barely noticeable to anyone else but I think because I know its there it bugs me. Is this normal for it to scab after an infection?

Gymnastics- TUMBLING mental block ??	So I used to be an amazing gymnast and used to tumble a lot (doing flips for people who don't know what tumbling is)Months ago I fell while tumbling (doing flips) and it was a bad fall and i felt so embarrassed infront of everybody. Now I can't tumble and lost almost every tumble skill. I've tried everything to get them back, vizualization, just growing the skill, even going back to basics.I even have a specialist to help with mental blocks but I don't think it helps too much. Has anyone any ideas? It's a really bad mental block and I really want to overcome it!!!Please help!!!

Football ~ Jim Kelly or Warren Moon?	I'd definitely go with Warren Moon. I don't know how you could deduct points for him playing in a run &amp; gun offense with the Oilers, he was still good after leaving even in his later years. Moon is pound for pound the better thrower, threw one of the tightest spirals, definitely the more prolific passer and if your gonna penalyze him for runnin &amp; gunnin you gotta acknowledge that Kelly ran a no huddle offense another way of putting up large passing totals. Only thing Jim Kelly really has on him is making it to the Super Bowl four years in a row although you could argue Kelly played on much better offenses

Ive also ordered a paste from Amazon.But as I was stocking our fruit bowl today, it dawned on me, that they maybe be attracted to our fruit. Should I wrap it for the time being? Put in the fridge?

My dog has had diarrhea for about three months...any suggestions or ideas as to what is going on?	My 11&amp;1/2 year-old Boston Terrier has had diarrhea for about three months.  Sometimes it's a brown cowpie-like consistency but lately it's been a yellow color with a watery consistency.  We have been to the vet three or four times and her stool sample came back showing that she has no parasites.  Her rectal exam also came back normal.  We have been given hypoallergenic foods, anti-diarrhea pills, enzymes, and more but none of it has worked.  I've tried not feeding her for 24 hours then giving her gentle foods such as rice and ground beef then easing her back onto her regular diet but it hasn't worked either.  Because of her diarrhea she poops 3-4 times a day, has lost 2 pounds, and it drinking a lot more water.  She is still loving and acts completely normal; loves going on walks, getting pets, and greeting us at the door. 	I love my dog to death and I'd do anything for some advice from a knowledgeable person or someone who's dog has dealt with a similar situation.  I feel like I'm doing something wrong and I'm super desperate for a solution so my poor dog doesn't have to deal with diarrhea anymore.  Thank you so much to anyone who answers!

Wearing a short dress at the weekend, I don't normally leg my legs out...as they're very pale, I've old stretch marks on the backs of my legs, and knobbly knees...but I've been building confidence so gonna brave it.I can't wear tights, also I can't get the Sally Hansen Airbrush Legs (I'm on a tight budget).I use laser hair removal, plus I exfoliate and use moisturizer daily, so my legs are smooth. 	I'm thinking of adding foundation to my moisturizer, also using a little coconut oil for glow.Any other tips?

Are fishnet stockings slutty?	Let me clarify, i'm 17. I usually dress in things like snapbacks, hightops, wristbands, and for example eminem shirts. I'm sure you can figure out my usual style from that. I have a boyfriend if that matters. I bought fishnet stockings and wore them around my house, i felt cute and they made me feel skinnier. I was currently struggling with anorexia. My brother, who i usually get along with said i'm dressing like a prostitute and no wonder my dad left us. He's usually super nice to me, so it made me think. My mom told me i can wear them around the house, under ripped jeans, and out when i'm 18, which i totally respect. But can i wear these around the house with shorts? I dont want to be slutty, i'm the most loyal person you'd ever meet. Your opinion and advice?

What s wrong with my dog?	I recently got a pitbull.. He was my brothers who used to live with me and my brother basically abandoned him when he moved out. Which isn t an issue to me at all because I love the little guy. It s been about 4 months since my brother left.. He only had him for about 3 months himself. I m not sure of his history before my brother but he s always been skiddish as if he d been abused. Loud noises, or any sudden noise makes him jump and run (fourth of July was hell for the poor guy)  .. Lately he s been acting very strange. Having accidents in the house when he has access to the dog door and knows how to use it, he only had prior accidents when the dog door was covered (my other dog jumps the gate so it s hard, he has to be watched while outside but we recently built a taller fence for my other dog so the dog door is always open now)  well he s been having accidents, and now he will very often go outside using the dog door and then basically forget how to come back in. He barks at the door until I open the door for him to come in. Sometimes he uses it just fine and others he just doesn t want to use it to come in. I think his accidents may be him not wanting to use the door to go out either..  What could be causes his new behavior? Stress/anxiety is my guess from all the changes he s gone through.

Skin help needed?	So this isn't the WORST thing possible, but it is definitely something I find very irritating. I have struggled with skin-related problems for a while. They have improved compared to what it was like when I first started having issues, but I'm no where near where I want to be yet.I don't get as many break outs or as severe ones, but I still get them. I'm glad they're better, but even one or two acne spots is too much for me. I want to go back to having CLEAR skin all the time like I used to. My biggest goals right now are to clear my skin the rest of the way entirely (get rid of some lingering blackheads around my nose and chin area, eliminate the one pimple I have, remove the old pinkish marks I have from breakouts in the past), and prevent new/future breakouts.Note - I am an all-natural type of person... so NO CHEMCIAL suggestions please. And as for natural things - lemon irritates my skin, tea tree oil and lavender oil didn't really work all that good and Sulfur didn't either.I have been drinking way more water lately and looking into diet changes such as searching for dairy-free options or at the least avoiding cow milk (I never was one to actually drink plain cow milk, but I did consume it through cooking), including more fruits and greens/veggies into my diet through smoothies (haven't started that yet as I need a better blender - suggestions for one as well as some yummy recipes?), etc. Will those things help? What else can I do for success?

How much does a visit to the vet cost?	My shih tzu is a year and a half old. She was fine throughout the year but recently, she's starting to feel lazy or sleepy most of the time. She's still active but not as much. So I might consider taking her to the vet this month. Money is a tight issue and a problem within my family but we'll have to work it out for the sake of our shih tzu. I was wondering how much is a checkup and a vaccination cost at the vet? I don't want my dog to have any problems later on. If it helps, I'm in the state of Connecticut

When I got home I noticed that both of them have an underbite. And, their top canine teeth comes in contact with their bottom gum. I took them to the vet and she confirmed what I saw. The dental tean suggested pulling the baby canines and also the adult teeth when they come in. The breeder tells me that it is way too early to assume that the adult teeth will grow crooked and  I also tells me to not do surgery on them yet and wait till the adult teeth comes in. My question is there a possibility that their adult teeth will grow correct and if I decide to breed them only once with other cats I have will all their offspring have this bite ?

Why do some fans think the WWF/WWE in The Attitude Era was only exclusive to the 1990's ?	The AE didn't begin until 1997 but there was a lot of things happening before that which eventually led to its creation. RAW began in 1993, Hulk Hogan and many other former guys from the WWE started to go over there and this was in 1994 - 95. RAW began struggling in the ratings even back then without those guys, they were forced to take the company in the ECW route and it went on until 2001 I think. That's already two years in the 00's so if you take away the stuff that happened earlier and just go from 1997 to 2002, that was only 5 years and it started very late in the 1990's. But that period is what people remember even though it was also in 2000, 2001 and even a few months into 2002 before the WWF became the WWE.

So the boy's signature cannot be verified, which means everything that he signed last year is worthless, at least as far a memorabilia collectors are concerned.

According to court documents, after marketing agent Alan Zucker submitted a request for two game-used helmets and jerseys, Manning sent an email to equipment manager Joe Skiba that read, &quot;2 helmets that can pass as game used. That is it. Eli.&quot;	Skiba has admitted that Manning created the fake memorabilia because he &quot;didn't want to give up the real stuff.&quot; One fake game-used helmet from Manning is supposedly in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. 	Manning cheats the fans by masquerading as an NFL quarterback and he's cheated them a second time by passing on bogus memorabilia.	Why hasn't the league stepped in to punish Manning and the Giants? The NFL makes a ton of money each year off of memorabilia sales and what they have done has damaged the league's reputation in that regard.

I would like to ask people from this section, do you think that a lot of English clubs do not give young players enough of a chance?	As a foreigner who watches English football, I have noticed that many clubs do not give young players enough of a chance. Even when they give the young players a chance, they seem to make a judgement on him too quickly. You have cases where young players do not have a great first season and then they are sold by the end of the season.Young players are in the stage of development. You need to give them at least 2 or 3 seasons before making a judgement on the young players. Especially if the young player is a foreigner in new surroundings and in a different environment that they are probably used to. We have seen how clubs like Chelsea and Man Utd have sold young players prematurely only to see those players develop into top stars.Should the English clubs give young players more of a chance?

His diet consists of a cup of veggies (bok choy and cilantro),1/8 cup of oxbow essentials adult rabbit food, and unlimited timothy hay and water. If this matters, yesterday, he produced small pellets (which I thought was GI Stasis) but now he's producing regular pellets again. He also produced red urine, despite drinking alot of water.

How to train a guys hair to go up/back in the front?	People tell me I would have to grow out my hair longer and wear a hat or a band if you are working but that seem like i have to maintain my hair alot. I was also told there was an alternate way doing it which was to buzz you hair then wear a hat most of the time. My brother naturally has short hair that stays up all the time because he keeps the product in his hair overnight so he doesn't have to restyle it. I tried that before years ago but I was getting oily skin a lot and was also breaking out by heat exposure as well. I would like to buzz my hair if it would help naturally grow out if I just wear a hat to keep my hair from growing forward. I can't see myself having longer hair.

My dog died on Fourth of July and I m so sad, what do I do?	About 6-7 years ago I found her abandoned. I was just about 14 at the time. She was tied to a tree and I posted pictures of her everywhere, contacted locals, and called the police. Nothing. Later on I officially adopted her, and registered her. A couple months later she was acting weird, and I turned out she had 8 puppies! This was an extreme shock to me. Anyways, I always her clothing, and food, water, shelter, etc. fast forward to now. On July forth she passed away. She was sick for the past couple of days, but looked normal, walked, played, but I did see her a bit sad. And since it was the holidays, I decided to take her after they reopen since everything was closed that week. Idk what happened! I woke up and she was dead. My heart sank, and started to tear up.... my mom helped me bury her in the backyard, and I gave her a prayer, I hope she's somewhere better now. Now, here's my question. Since she is registered, what do I tell my veterinarian? Hi, good morning, my dog died? This was my first dog and I have no idea what to tell the vet. What do I do in this case?

Colts ProBowl LT admits they cheated for years.. Why are they exempt from the rules?	Tarik Glenn of the Colts says his offensive line coach gave their linemen hearing aids to help drown out crowd noise for their favorite stat-padder. The use of unauthorized electronic equipment being employed is a clear violation of the rules, but this isn't the first time.Indy's RCA Dome once had an elaborate (and probably illegal) system of signs that facilitate when the crowd should be disruptive or quiet. In 2006 the Steelers drew an unprecedented number of false starts and accused Indy of amplifying artificial crowd noise through their loud speakers to disrupt snap counts. Bill Polian &quot;looked into the matter&quot; and determined no wrong doing.A year latter against the Pats, everyone who was watching the game heard the fake crowd noise skip like a scratched TV over the announcers voices then come to an abrupt silence. Polian once again &quot;investigated&quot; but found &quot;nothing&quot;.In 2016 the Falcons were docked a draft pick over fake crowd noise, we all know the story with the &quot;Spygate&quot; fiasco and Brady's unjustified suspension despite no rule breaking being determined by virtually everyone. So why in the hell aren't the Colts docked multiple first rounders, handed out suspensions and finned penalties the way everyone else is?http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2017/07/03/tarik-glenn-seems-to-suggest-colts-used-an-illegal-communication-system/

Can't swim very good but going on a lads holiday very soon....?	Hi,	I'm going on a lads holiday in three weeks and I'm very worried about it because I'm not a very confident swimmer. I can't tred water and struggle to a length. When I first learnt about 5 years ago I could do length after length because I was used to it but I'm a bit rusty now. I went for a swim about 2 months ago and because of crap technique I struggled to do a length. This worries me because of being in the pool and sea with friends. I'm going swimming with a friend on Sunday to get some practice in but what else could I do to regain confidence?? Maybe hire a instructor for a few lessons??

And two, if they would be able to fit through the bars if they ever do try to get out (there are slightly older feeder rats at the place where I would be getting them, but most seem to be 6 months or younger).Thank you!

Why do Olympic shooters get so much hate?	Lately i've been watching some Olympic replays of shooting and older ISSF competitions, and i've noticed that so many people hate on it. The comment section is filled with people, insulting the sport, the athletes, saying things like, &quot;JERRY MICULEK CAN SHOOT 12 ROUNDS IN 2.99 SECONDS HE IS BETTER THAN THESE WIMPS&quot; and &quot;I CAN SHOOT MORE ACCURATELY WITH A 20 YEAR OLD RIFLE&quot;.These people don't seem to understand the concept of Olympic shooting. It's not about how fast you can shoot steel plates but how accurately you can shoot at a target.Olympic shooters use iron sights on all their guns and shoot at tiny targets while Jerry shoots big steel plates with holographic sights (usually).The biggest difference is that in Olympic pistol shooting shooters shoot with one hand, while Jerry uses both hands. The reason for that is that, during the time of the first Olympic Games everybody shot pistols one handedly. Only in the late 50s did people start shooting with both hands, but Olympic shooting stayed the same.Comparing Jerry and Olympic Shooters is like comparing apples to oranges. Completely two different disciplines.They also LOVE to make fun of the gear they wear (jackets and glasses). They don't even do research to realise the purpose why they wear it.They get so much hate for doing what they love.

How can I fix up my wood balcony on the second floor on a budget?	Recently my grandma has been sick so we moved her down stairs and I moved up stairs. Now this house is old and has a lot of problems. The room I moved into has a sliding glass door that opens up to a balcony and steps on the side. I have 3 dogs and 3 cats. They all love using the balcony to go in and out. My problem with that is that the wood is rotting and is weak. I'm afraid to walk out on it. My pit bull is 83 pounds and my rottypit mix pup is supposed to get up to 100 pounds. I'm only 125 so if it's weak for me it will be weak for my pups. I'm also moving out in a year and dont want to put to mucn money into something thats not going to stay with. Is there any way to make it safe to walk on. Let the dogs sun bath out on it have a nice little sitting spot with plants and humming bird feeders. Would putting a big plank of wood over the old rotting wood work. Have the wait spread out instead of all on one spot or should I just close the door and lock it up.

I would love to make a little chill spot with hanging plants and hummingbird feeders and sit outside with my pets as they sun bath. I'm also moving out in a year. Is there anyway to fix is check and easy. I was thinking a big plank of wood and laying it over the old rotting wood. That way when me or the pets step on it the weight would be spread out instead of on one spot. Would that work? Is there a better way or should I just shut the door and lock it for good

Why does my dog follow me?	I always get a feeling that my dog visits me in my room when I'm asleep. She sleeps in the living room. Sometimes I wake up and my bedroom door is open and a book is on the floor. She could've easily gotten in just by poking the door with her head. She occasionally follows me around the house too. She's three years old and is a small dog. She waits for me when I come home. She won't follow my parents, just me. Someone suggested it might be because I'm the only kid in the family - but I don't think dogs can sense your age.

Were Cavaliers wrong in low balling Chauncey Billups or no?	Sources maintain that financial compensation wasn't the only reason Billups turned down the job on Monday after weeks of deliberation, but it played a part.&quot;According to ESPN, Dan Gilbert and the Cavs low-balled Billups, offering him well below the league average salary for the position which is around $4 million.&quot;According to sources, the team's initial offer was $1.5 million. League sources told ESPN that $4 million is typically the starting point of what an individual in that role should earn.&quot;

Questions about submitting cover letter to literary magazine?	Two questions -I submitted a story to a literary magazine that was published. Now I am submitting a second story. Should I keep the opening from before about how I'd always wanted to have my work in this magazine? Should I indicate that I have been published in there magazine before? I am not sure they will just remember me since they receive submissions from so many authors. How should I indicate this?  I thought of simply adding them to the &quot;my work has appeared in&quot; section, but don't want it to seem like a form cover letter.Second question - I have only ever submitted to 2 magazines, both of which I adore. I want to submit to other magazines now, but have not been a long time reader of any of them. Most cover letter dos and donts strongly recommend an opening saying how you have read such and such story from the magazine, but if I have not, I just feel so insincere faking it like that. Is it okay simply saying I'm writing because I think my story would be a good fit/interested in publication etc?

My wife would want to have a son circumcised if we had a son. I strongly would not. What should I/we do?	My wife and I don't have kids yet but we are considering trying.  My wife recently said if she had a son, she'd want to have him circumcised.  Her reasoning is due to hygiene (she thinks it would be easier to keep clean), and she believes it would reduce the risk of STDs etc.  She also used to work as a nurse and said she has seen some bad cases of intact men having problems with cleanliness.  However, I am not circumcised and have never had a problem with it.  I feel strongly against having it done because I feel like it's a part of someone else's body, it's there for a reason, and it would be ethically wrong to remove a part of someone's body without their consent.  I might even go so far as to call it physical assault when done without someone's consent.  I hate the thought of doing that to someone.  I'm not sure what to do..  If I had a son that was circumcised shortly after birth, I don't think I could easily live with myself.

I've lost trust in society i always thought more males were uncircumcised. It's nice that it's decreasing in the us but it doesn't change the fact for the males that were circumcised. doctors who circumcised males and parents who allowed it just ruined their sons opportunity of having a good sex life.

To avoid this on my chest, I started plucking the dark hairs, only for there to be red, pimple-like bumps all over it. I ve tried everything from using warm rags to soften the hairs to exfoliating to moisturizing after, but my skin never looks normal.Please help me to remedy this. As a female, it s so embarrassing. I can t wear my hair up without makeup on my neck, and I m too embarrassed to wear v-neck shirts. :(

For me it's Tetsuya Naito, he's the only one of the big four who's not holding a championship or in a current feud. Kenny Omega is first and current IWGP United States heavyweight champion, Tanahashi is the current IC champ and Okada is in his 5th heavyweight reign. Naito is currently in limbo and I'd be down for a wrestle kingdom 12 mainevent match between Okada and Naito. So who do you think is gonna win?

Strange medical episode while swimming... What happened?	This happened to me some time ago (like a decade). I was swimming with friends and family in an indoor swimming pool. I had just jumped in and been submerged for a few seconds. I had only gone down a foot or two. Nothing unusual about the descent or ascent until I emerged to breathe and couldn't. I may as well have been trying to breathe water, the air felt so dense and my lungs felt so small. Through much gasping and sputtering (which caught no one's attention amazingly) I managed to grasp the pool ledge and get my breathing back to normal.	I always thought it might've been the Benz and when I ask the people who were there they don't remember what I'm referring to.	Could it have been from landing in the water at a weird angle?

I know I shouldn't care what people think but it'd give me way more confidence to look at least a year or two older.

I don't wanna live in a country with circumcised males I will never forgive society for circumcising males without them being old enough to decide for themselves. Society has ruined for males to feel more sensitivity(pleasure). You need the foreskin to get the best pleasure jerking off, without the foreskin means less pleasure. Are more males under 20 uncircumcised or circumcised in the USA?

Cat owners: how do I make my cat feel less depressed?	After taking my cat to the vet he unfortunately has to wear a cone for 2 weeks. The minute we got home his personality changed a lot: he became more scared and shaky, has been eating less, goes to the bathroom less and just stays in bed all day now. I know he hates the cone and I feel guilty making him wear it but it s for his own good and health. Is there anything I can do to make my cat feel comfortable again without having to remove the cone?

I was on a trip so my boyfriend and I didn't have sex again until July 6th.The last of my active pills was taken eight days ago though. And I haven't gotten my period at all. I don't know why I would have gotten my period in the middle of active pills and now that I'm off active pills, I haven't gotten anything. Did I just get my period a week early, or could I somehow be pregnant?

The high school coaches always tell me they're looking forward to me playing for high school, but I don't really want to play. I also play volleyball and cheer, and cheer and basketball run into each other a lot. I am pretty good at volleyball, and my parents are always talking to me about getting a scholarship for basketball, but I want a scholarship for volleyball more than anything. I want to quit basketball and really focus on volleyball, but I don't want to make the coaches, the team, or my parents mad. My dad is constantly getting on me about practicing basketball outside of practice, but when it comes to volleyball, just tells me that what we do in practice is fine and doesn't push me to practice outside of school practice. I really love volleyball WAY more than basketball, but I feel like I'm playing for others, and not myself. I just don't love it anymore :/

Why do I have excess fat above my belly button?	Hi guys, so I'm pretty young, 14 in fact and female. I'm about to go into highschool and this has really bothered me. Through sixth and the majority of 7th grade I gained a TON of weight, mainly do to steriods, which I was on for medical reasons. And then the summer going into 8th I lost a ton of the weight, prob 25-30 pounds. I also got taller, so my body was more in porportion. I'm a pretty muscular girl overall, but there's this one thing that bothers me. When I was fat you could see my belly button, but now that I lost the weight there is this clump of fat that hangs over my belly button? It makes me look like I have a ðŸ˜� face on my stomach. If I pull the fat up then I look great, but with it I am so uncomfortable. It isn't a huge thing of fat, maybe an inch or so over my belly button, but I am terrified to be at a pool or a beach or anything because of it. I worked so hard to get rid of my fat, but now i just look like I have a huge roll. What is this? What causes it? How should I treat it? (I'm a relatively healthy eater, I excercize a few times a week, and I really only drink water.)

At the same time, though I feel kinda bad about myself if I eat over like 1250 calories. I've just generally been stressing about food &amp; calories &amp; stuff quite a bit lately &amp; would like some opinions on my diet.Breakfast: 45g of cereal with a bit of milk or scrambled eggs on a piece of toast (200-ish calories)	Lunch: a super grains bar (115 calories) or a banana (100-ish calories) or a piece of toast with peanut butter ( 180-ish calories)	Tea: about 1/2 a 9&quot; plate of stirfry/roast vegetables, 1/4 of beans &amp; some kind of vegetarian meat or 1/4 of potato/kumara (450/500-ish calories) or bulgur wheat salad (400-ish calories)	Snack: a green apple/a kiwifruit &amp; like 5 pecans/almonds (150-ish calories)	The calories might be way off since I don't measure everything, I just make an educated guess.I rock climb 1-3 times a week &amp; take at least 5000 steps most days btw (:

My main character lived in fear most of her life believing she was dangerous and going to hurt the people she loved because these sick twisted thoughts would pop inside her head of her being this murderous evil crazy person. She found out she had OCD and finally felt free from her fears until she was given immortality and gained a supernatural gift to go with it.At first I thought of giving her a gift that with one touch she could heal all mental or psychical illnesses and make people extremely. Her hands could also push away attacks from others and sense danger.I like that gift, but I think I want to give her a little more conflict then that. I want her gift to be very dark and harmful, and she fears it and refuses to use it, but struggles to control it at times. Kind of like frozen with Elsa's power, but I don't want her to have ice powers.Any suggestions?

8th grade makeup advice?	i m going into 8th grade, and i need some advice on what kind of makeup to get. i am mostly looking for foundation, since i used BB cream in 7th grade (may or may not stick to this). i really want a step up from that though. does anybody know of any good foundations, that a 14 year old girl should use? not too expensive, because i don t want to spend all my money on makeup. i am planning on asking an employee at Ulta or Sephora, but i wanted another s opinion as well.

Tingling/Numb in my fingertips, legs, feet?	So I pop my knees &amp; fingers &amp; basically anything on my body all the time, it's just a habit of mine. anyways I have been getting in the habit of popping my knees a lot so much that I will try to force it ( I'm an idiot ) &amp; the other day I tried &amp; it became sore &amp; kept getting more sore so I thought maybe I just made it sore from doing it so much, but my knee still hurts &amp; feels absolutely weird like a tight feeling &amp; it's swollen, AND last night I just started to feel tingling in my leg, then it went to my feet. Both of them then eventually my fingertips felt numb &amp; I thought it would be gone by the morning but nope. Still happening. &amp; all day at work my legs &amp; feet would be numb &amp; tingling.

Why does my dog check up on me when I'm sleeping?	I see signs that my dog was in my room when I wake up such as some details of my room are different than I left it. Maybe a book fell to the ground, one of her toys suddenly appeared, or the bedroom door is wide open. I caught her coming inside my room just to take a quick peek then she went back to the living room where she sleeps. She's three years old and is a very small dog. I'm a 15 year old and an only child with parents who work all the time in the city so I spend a lot of time with her. In the daytime, she occasionally checks up to see what I'm doing too. If I'm socializing with someone, she seems to care a lot about who that person is and checks them out first (sniffs them, stays in the same room as them for a while, etc). It's boiling hot here in Canada (for once!) and I take her outside whenever I go out except for when I hang out with friends because it might be too hot for her indoors, which means she gets even more time with me in the summer. Is she attached to me in any way?

Is a rabbit good for me?	My friend has baby bunnies and I want to get one but I want to know if I would be a good fit. I'm soon to be 18 and still in high school and going to live with my patents until after college (Gonna be a vet tech). I've had rabbits before when I was younger but none for a few years. I would get a cage for it to go in when I'm not not (for school or work) and night but when I'm home it would be able to run around in the &quot;fence&quot; I would buy. The cage would not be a tiny one it would have enough room to lay down and it would be tall enough for it to stand up. I would make sure it had at least two hours a day of being able to run around. It would have as much as possible like all night after school if I don't work and also much of the time on the weekends and also if my brothers decide to play with it if they want when I'm not home. I also have two dogs and a cat but the dogs would never be alone with it even when it's in the cage. No small children in the house. We're all over 13 and I would do my research to make sure it had the proper food and toys and such but I just want to know if it would be okay with being in the cage. It would be given attention and I'd litter train it. Also would get it fixed when the times comes. I'm also up for recommendations on what to get and some tips on care. It would be more than a month before I get it so I have plenty of time to prepare.  Would it be okay? Thanks!

Teams were allowed to play hard on defense and there was also a lot more variety in the way they scored.  Lots of skilled big men down low and mid range jump shooters.  Nowadays they just set a screen draw a double team and kick it out to a three point shooter.  They often don't even bother to do that, they just run it up the court and shoot from beyond the arc even with a hand in their face.

I can eat okay, it s not painful, and I clean it after every meal and so and so....anyways, my swelling is still there and I m talking kinda funny.

I have different answers. I would love to hear your answer in a one succinct paragraph?	Two people return to their long neglected garden and find among the weeds a few of the old plants surprisingly vigorous. One says to the other, &quot;It must be that a gardener has been coming and doing something about these plants.â€� Upon inquiry they find that no neighbor has ever seen anyone at work in their garden. The first man says to the other, &quot;He must have worked while people slept.&quot; The other says, &quot;No, someone would have heard him and besides, anybody who cared about the plants would have kept down these weeds.&quot; The first man says, &quot;Look at the way these are arranged. There is purpose and a feeling for beauty here. I believe that someone comes, someone invisible to mortal eyes. I believe that the more carefully we look the more we shall find confirmation of this.&quot; 	They examine the garden ever so carefully and sometimes they come on new things suggesting that a gardener comes and sometimes they come on new things suggesting the contrary and even that a malicious person has been at work. Besides examining the garden carefully, they also study what happens to gardens left without attention. Each learns all the other learns about this and about the garden. 	Consequently, when after all this, one says, &quot;I still believe a gardener comes,&quot; while the other says, &quot;I don't,&quot;			What is the difference between them?

Can this grey mold harm me?	I was looking in my recycling been for cans, and found an old Guinness can. I always wanted to know what he ball inside of the can looked like. So I cut it open and all of a sudden grey fumes which I assume are spores came out like smoke. I looked inside to see what it was and there was a large clump of grey mold. Once I figured that out I threw it away immediately. I unfortunately breathed in a fair amount of &quot;fumes&quot;. How screwed am I and how can I prevent myself from getting sick or hopefully not kick the mediforical bucket?

Vitamin C Method to Get First Period?	So, I'm 13 and haven't gotten my first period yet. My mom, doctor, and friends all think that my period will come any day. They've been saying that for months! So, I'm trying the Vitamin C Method to make it come quicker. I take 3000 mg daily (1500 in the morning and at night). Is it dangerous to take this much? Should I take more or less mg to speed up this process?

How to get over fear of failure?	This probably sounds stupid, but I have a pretty severe fear of failure. It's affecting my school and athletic performance (especially school). For example, whenever test results are posted, I get anxiety attacks and start to shake uncontrollably. I don't know what's wrong with me! AP Exam results came out two weeks ago, and I still haven't checked mine because whenever I get the courage to do so, I get dizzy and nauseous. I'm a runner, and before every competitive race I throw up because I'm too scared to commit to it! I don't know why I get triggered like this (I also have bipolar).

How to care for our new kitty?	About a week ago my boyfriend and I found a cat laying in the middle of the road, presumably hit by a car. My boyfriend has had a couple of pets killed by cars, and now as a result he moves roadkill animals off the road so no pet owner has to deal with the headache of scraping their pet off the pavement the way he has. However when he got out to move this kitty he was still alive. Unable to afford the vet bill, we took him to the overnight drop box at out local shelter and came back to see if he made it the next day. Now a week later he's bounced back and can walk, run,  jump, and eat on his own. The girls at the shelter have been asking us about adopting him and we think it's a lovely idea. However, the damage done to him after getting hit has left him with a head tilt. Because of this we've affectionately given him the name Wybie, after the little boy from the movie Coraline who walk around with his head tilted to the side like our kitty. He can walk, run, and jump, but he can't do it straight. How can we care for our little Wybie the best we can given his disability?

I have no motivation and it is destroying my life.?	I can't find the motivation to do anything. I'm 21 years old, and I work as a bus Person at a restaurant 30 hours a week. I've had the owner of a car business tell me that I can call him whenever I want if I want work, and I can never motivate myself to call him. I can't even motivate myself to do my laundry or clean my apartment half the time. All I ever want to do is drink, play video games. I've lost interest in guitar playing, one of my strings broke and I can't bring myself to drive to the music store and buy new strings, the only thing I ever spend my money on is beer almost every night. My dad rides me all the time about how I never do anything except drink and sit on the computer. I realize that these are all problems but I can't bring myself to fix them. My dad thinks it's just because I'm a lazy piece of you know what. I told him the I would kill him, and of course I didn't actually mean it, I was just mad at the time I don't actually want to kill him and he pretty much resents me now. He told me that if my other 2 brothers stopped talking to him it would bother him, but if I stopped talking to him it wouldn't bother him one bit. I don't think it's because I'm lazy I think they're more deep rooted issues that are going on with me, and I don't know what to do. I'm considering seeking professional help, I don't know whether to do outpatient therapy or impatient. My lifestyle right now has become unmanageable and I need help.

Can someone help me understand a healthier diet?	Ok so I was 150 pounds and I am 5'8. I'm a little chubbier then I want to be so I started to try to diet. I never really knew how many calories I was consuming but I tried to do a 1,100 calorie diet with low carbs (and I guess fat as well) I've been using the app myfitnesspal to track my foods for the days. So far, I have lost 6 pounds however I'm not seeing much changes in my body. The real problem here is I have a limit (on the app) of 97g of carbs a day and 37g of fat a day. I'm doing good with my protein and staying under these is just fine for me. However, I'm not reaching my 1,100 calories for the day !! I thought it would be hard to consume so little calories but turns out I'm not getting enough. I don't think this is healthy to consume too little and I'm afraid I'm going to start losing body fat. I'm also a vegetarian so what should I do?? Are the amount of carbs and fat I'm getting a day healthy as well? (Sorry for the lengthy paragraph)

You are on pain medication which works most of the time but you will always regret lifting something heavy, most exercises, and all  but very gentle sex.The only thing left is to have it removed BUT the doctors give you a 50/50 chance that the pain will continue as &quot;ghost pain&quot; and nothing further could be done.

I'm 13, and I've always had them. I can remember them being there years and years ago. I'm healthy, and not on any kind of medication.

She coughed- more blood, but she ignored it, and navigated around the broken glass on the sidewalk. Her designer heels were long gone, ditched at least five miles ago. The train of her long silver gown trailed on the ground, the tulle  completely tattered and blackened from dirt. The thin material of the silk waist flapped open, exposing her bruised stomach.

Frequent diarrhea bathroom trips (especially right after eating)?	I apologize for the gross and personal nature of this post, but I ve searched everywhere and can t seem to find an answer.I had my gallbladder removed about four years ago, and ever since then, I ve had to go to the bathroom urgently and do my business (which usually ends up in small amounts of diarrhea). Even now, right after eating, or even in the middle of eating, I get the urge to go, and when I do it s a small amount of diarrhea.I do not have any abdominal pain, fever, or any other symptoms. It doesn t matter what I eat, everything makes me feel this way. I do not take laxatives, I m not allergic to anything, and do not have any other symptoms besides what I stated before. Should I go to a doctor, or is an uncommon side effect that I shouldn t worry about? Are there any ideas how I can lighten the frequency, or make it stop altogether?Side note - I do have &quot;solid&quot; bathroom trips, but only when I eat a lot of meat. Not sure if that helps or not.Thank you to all who help with this, or have similar experiences

Do you think I could be a foreign host?	I'm a young guy who's barely in my twenties, and I was thinking of learning Japanese, and to start living my life in Japan once I'm fluent. To begin my dreams of living in Japan, I thought about starting off as a host at a host club. In Japan, it's not uncommon for Japanese women to pay guys huge sums of money for a couple of cocktails and a few hours of platonic companionship. The key is to be attractive, and to lure in women. I think I have an advantage because I'm foreign. However, to be honest, I'm not the greatest at picking up women because I'm introverted, but I could still make it possible for women to enjoy my presence, since I never had trouble in that area. A description about myself, I'm half French and half Mexican, so I have black hair, but somewhat tanned skin (hazel eyes). I have a swimmer's built, and quite skinny, but I have good muscular definition. I have a youthful face, so I look younger than my real age. As for my overall appearance towards women, I have had two or three random women come to my job just to see me in the past. Anyways, it's not an ideal job (hosting and all), but I think it's better than the other typical jobs as a foreigner (like teaching English to a classroom full of people).

And she has started sleeping way too heavily. Shes always been kind of skiddish and quiet and kept to herself. waking her up has never been a problem, either. Most of the time she would run away if someone even entered the room she was in. But now you have to yell or shake her for a minute or two. And when she does wake up she tries to bite or scratch and she hisses. When shes awake she sits in one spot and if anyone gets close to her she tries to bite. My toddler can just walk by and she will go out of her way to try and hurt him. Including our other cat who is her sibling and shes always been close with, she s all of a sudden started attacking him randomly.

Can I ship something without putting it in a cardboard box?	I recently sold a pair of Nike Air Force 1 on eBay. I do have the original shoe box. I was wondering is it required for me to put the Nike shoe box into a cardboard box? I feel like this is uncessary. If I purchase a cardboard box from Canada post I would have to pay extra more for shipping when I can just ship the Shoes in the Nike box.

voices in my head?	as the question says, yes i have voices in my head multiple all telling me to do bad things, everyday they seem to get louder and louder and theirs nothing i can do to shut them up other than do what they have told me to do. i act normal everyday, everyday i have to put on a fake face and act happy. im 15 and going back to high school soon, i cant have theses voices distract me from my work. i cant tell where they have come from either. I've had a lot of stress building up in my short life, its giving me bad sleeping problems and multiple migraines, maybe thats why i hear the voices but still they are driving me insane the only way i can see to stop the voices is to take the easy way or to listen to what they say. they tell me to hurt people animals babys. Ive killed some local pets to shut them up, ive gutted slammed and burned animals to stop the voices and the worst part of that is that i almost enjoy doing those things, i chuckle and grin when i do things like that but i know its not the real me. they have been telling me to murder and torture my family but i dont want to, im on the edge now and i cant take the voices any longer. Im not going to a psychiatrist they will just lock me up but i shouldnt be locked up im a good person ive got great friends and school is just right around the corner. what will everyone think of me locked up, im a good person, please respond with understanding and other suggestions i can take to stop the voices

How many times a week should you do cardio and weight lifting?	I got into a dispute with my friend as he was saying you can work on cardio and lift weights only 1 or 2 times in a week!! I said that is pointless!! You need at least no less than 3 to 4 times a week to work on cardio and lift weights.So what is the magic number? Well, obvious athletes work out everyday. But working out 1 or 2 times in a week such seem really silly and pointless.Well some other people say well no less than three times in a week on cardio and lifting weights ?So what is the best number 3 or 4 times week? Is two times week okay?

Is 10th grade too late to start track?	I'm currently an incoming high school freshman planning on joining the track team next year. Everyone in track is really athletic, and I'm afraid of embarrassing myself if I end up being &quot;too slow&quot;. I'm faster than most of the other girls in regular P.E. (people who do track or any other major sport are in athletics instead of P.E.), and my friends say that I'm fast enough to do track. I think I'd be a decent short distance sprinter. Is 10th grade too late, or will I be okay?

There is this hole where the sand trap is kind of hidden, and no way anybody else can see him, but he still insists on pooping on pooping in this sand trap on this hole, because he says as long as nobody can see him, and that he buries it in the sand that its fine, and just like going to the bathroom in the forest.  I have tried asking him to stop doing it, but he has done it 3 times this summer already

What type of treadmill should I buy?	I have been saving up &amp; looking around for a good running treadmill. I would like the belt to be 58&quot;-60&quot; long because I am 5'7 and I read that it should be at least 58&quot;.I saw a nordic track treadmill at sears for around $1,000 &amp; with shipping &amp; tax it would have come up to about $2,500. I was so tempted to buy it mainly because it was 60&quot; long but I feel like sears may be over priced (as usual) &amp; I have seen many nordic track reviews that claim they are terrible at replying &amp; assisting customers with issues. The last thing i need is to spend $2,000 on a product who's company is dodgy &amp; abscent when in need of help.Anyways I would really appreciate it if someone with experience with treadmills could advise me a little.What companies are reputable &amp; will carry machines with belts 58&quot;-60&quot; long AND is a running treadmill NOT a walking treadmill.

Is calorie burning and losing weight a myth?	OK, so, 'the science' behind losing weight is, eat less calories and exercise more to burn off the calories you eat.A mans recommended calorie intake is 2000 per day, and if you want to lose weight you should cut that by 500 per day, equalling a loss.Walking and running burns about 100 calories per mile, and eating 1500 calories a day to lose weight means you have to burn 1501 to be on course.  That's 15 miles a day.Come on!!  Nobody does that.  Someone explain the math to me please!
